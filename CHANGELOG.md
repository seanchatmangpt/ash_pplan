# Changelog

## 26.9.6 - 2026-09-06

### Added

- P-PLAN/PROV-O-first canonical ontology and SHACL profile.
- ggen_igniter pack that manufactures the projection catalog from the canonical ontology.
- Thin `AshPPlan` execution/convenience surface over existing Reactor semantics.
- Explicit mappings to Ash.Reactor, AshOban, and scheduling instead of a new workflow runtime.
- Explicit `PersistentContinuation` gap rather than an unsupported durability claim.
- HDDL project/SDL plan, architecture documentation, producer lock, and Chicago-style manufacture tests.
- CI gates using both the pinned ggen-ecosystem container and ggen_igniter regeneration.
